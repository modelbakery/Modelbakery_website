Welcome to modelbakery personal website! I am a passionate R User with a strong background in Chemistry, Statistics and Analytics. I pursue a Master in Science at Warwick University major in Polymer Chemistry. Please check out my Resume for more details and some of my works here and GitHub consisting __Case Studies__ with Codes, Papers and Blogs.

I have always been lucky to find great mentors to shape my problem-solving mindset and grit. With this school of thought, I wish to supply the same and follow the motive of the “Pay it Forward” spirit. This portfolio will provide my willingness to adopt new skills, and ability to implement business acumen and logical reasonings to data.
